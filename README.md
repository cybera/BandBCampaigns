# Backdoors and Breaches Campaign Scenarios

A selection of scenarios that we've run through at Cybera. We hope sharing
these gives folks a starting point for when you want to run a more targeted
session and not run with RNG.

## Scenarios

### [000 Google Workspace](https://github.com/cybera/BandBCampaigns/blob/main/campaigns/000-Google-Workspace.md)

What would happen if someone's credentials to Google Workspace got popped?

### [001 Public Cloud Cryptominer](https://github.com/cybera/BandBCampaigns/blob/main/campaigns/001-Public-Cloud-Cryptominer.md)

What if our cloud was filled by Cryptominers?
